# BitCoin for Android Arabian Users

This is a fork of [Coins for Android](https://github.com/nothingmagical/coins-android)

I just translated the original Application and changed some colors, icons and fonts.

Also I reordered the currencies to put the Arabian currencies in the top of the list.

It's not my code to get credit for it and it's all [Nothing Magical](https://github.com/nothingmagical)'s work.

## License

Coins is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE). While the license says you can do whatever you want with it, I'd apprecaite it if you don't release an exact copy to the App Store. This is released as an open source project primarily for educational purposes. That said, there's nothing stopping you from doing whatever you want with it.
